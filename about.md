**For the hard facts at a glance, here is my [CV](/assets/CV_JoschaKrug.pdf).**

I am a 4th year PhD student at the University of Mannheim and work as a Researcher on Environmental and Climate Economics at [ZEW](https://www.zew.de/en/). Before entering the academic world, I worked for two years as an Economic Analyst in Frontier Economics' energy and competition practices.

I hold a master's degree in Economics from the London School of Economics and two bachelor's degrees in International Economics and Sociology from the University of TÃ¼bingen, all three of which are fondly remembered. I also spent a highly instructive semester at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow back in better times when it could still make a serious claim to academic independence. <!-- Read this sad but instructive [Meduza piece](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/04/21/hse-s-transformation-into-a-kremlin-controlled-research-institute) if you are interested in knowing more. -->

When I am not staring intently at a computer screen or trying to convince a seminar audience of my new paper idea, you may find me playing impro theatre, taking overly elaborate boardgames way too seriously or pretending I know the first thing about coffee.
