My research centres around questions of industrial decarbonisation. Using micro data, I analyse the behaviour of industrial firms and attempt to explain it based on economic models. I am currently focused on understanding the role of energy prices in firms' decision-making, in particular with respect to their choice of products and their investment decisions.

In related research, I also do some work on clean energy finance. My focus in this line of research is on the role that government can play in mobilising credit for novel technologies in the presence of financial learning spillovers.

For my empirical analyses, I use a wide range of descriptive, quasi-experimental and semi-structural econometric methods. I frequently work with highly granular administrative firm data from Germany and have a particular expertise in the German manufacturing sector and the energy- and climate-related policies that govern it.
