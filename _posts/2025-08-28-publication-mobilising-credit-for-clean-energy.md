I am happy to share that our study on [*Mobilizing credit for clean energy: De-risking and public loan provision under learning spillovers*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2025.103222) -- joint work with Paul Waidelich and Bjarne Steffen from ETH ZÃ¼rich -- has just been published in the *Journal of Environmental Economics & Management*.

In it, we study how governments can effectively ensure that promising but immature technologies -- think, for instance, of offshore wind power as a recent example -- receive sufficient funding to become financially viable in the long run. Obviously, a carbon price and research subsidies are a key part of the answer. But we make the point that there is a *financial* side to the problem as well that calls for a **smartly designed mix of loan subsidies** (e.g. credit guarantees) **and public loans** (e.g. direct funding from state investment banks like KfW or EIB).

These financial policies can help **kickstart novel technologies** that are too risky to receive private funding at an early stage. Through the experience that financial institutions gain from early-stage investment, the technologies can become economically viable in the long run and attract the amount of private capital required for large-scale deployment.

This is because banks charge a substantial immaturity premium when providing loans to a novel technology, that may have no track record and an unfamiliar payout and risk profile. This makes projects based on the technology prohibitively expensive in the beginning. However, as the **financial sector gathers sufficient experience** with the technology, the immaturity premium can shrink to a point where such projects do become profitable even without government support.

To achieve such long-run profitability, the two most common financial policies -- de-risking private loans (through credit guarantees or other implicit loan subsidies) and directly providing public loans -- have different strengths and weaknesses that should be combined in a smart way. De-risking subsidies can ensure that each bank takes into account the positive effect of its own early-stage loan provision on sector-wide long-term profits. Public loans can directly generate financing experience with the new technology. The former is helpful to solve the **cooperation problem** -- meaning that banks will under-invest in the novel technology because they do not consider that their early-stage investment will have positive spillover effects on the sector as a whole. The latter can solve the **coordination problem** -- meaning that the banking sector may remain stuck in a 'bad equilibrium' where no bank invests into the novel technology because it is likely to fail unless sufficient other banks follow suit.
