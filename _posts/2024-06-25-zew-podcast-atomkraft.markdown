Together with my colleague Bastian Th√ºne, I talk about nuclear power from an economic perspective in the [latest episode of the ZEW podcast](https://www.zew.de/das-zew/aktuelles/atomkraft-jein-danke-ueber-das-oekonomische-fuer-und-wider). (The episode is available in German only.) I make the case that nuclear power is far more expensive than renewables from a private operator's perspective but that governments may have reasons to push for nuclear power generation for example due to potentially lower costs of the power system as a whole.
