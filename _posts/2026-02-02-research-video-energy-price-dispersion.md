Exciting news: [Latest Thinking](https://lt.org/publication/why-german-manufacturing-isnt-getting-more-energy-efficient) -- a video platform specialised on disseminating scientific work -- has just published a research video in which I summarise the key arguments of my recent [working paper on the role of energy price dispersion]({% link _posts/2025-09-24-working-paper-product-choice.md %}) (joint work with my colleagues Kathrine von Graevenitz and Elisa Rottner)!

In the paper, my coauthors and I show how selective energy price relief measures may have a substantial negative effect on energy efficiency (and hence emissions). We hypothesise that the vast prevalence of such measures in the past (like the exemption from the Renewable Energy Surcharge for many particularly energy-intensive firms) has contributed to the fact that the German manufacturing sector did not become any more energy efficient in the two decades leading up to the energy price shock in 2022.
